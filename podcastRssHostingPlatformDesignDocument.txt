Introduction

This document details the design and implementation plan for a podcast RSS hosting platform. The platform aims to provide seamless content management, automated transcription and metadata generation, robust RSS feed management, and comprehensive chapter tagging for enhanced listener experience.

Features

Content Management System (CMS)
	•	Podcast Management: Ability to input podcast artwork and descriptions.
	•	Episode Management: Functionality to upload audio files, episode-specific artwork, and metadata compliant with the Podcast 1.0 specification.
	•	Metadata Generation: Automatic generation of additional metadata, including keywords, topics, and named entities, to enhance discoverability.

Speech-to-Text (STT) and AI Integration
	•	Transcription: Utilize Cloudflare’s Whisper V3 Turbo to transcribe audio files into VTT format, stored appropriately.
	•	Description Generation: Employ Claude Sonnet 3.7 to generate episode descriptions based on transcriptions, adhering to a predefined template.

RSS Feed Management
	•	Feed Publishing: Generate and publish RSS XML files conforming to standard podcast formats, ensuring compatibility with platforms like Apple Podcasts and Spotify.
	•	Feed Updating: Automatically update and republish the RSS feed upon the addition of new episodes, maintaining a complete history.
	•	Versioning: Store previous versions of RSS XML files in object storage, with references maintained in a relational database for version control.

Chapter Tagging
	•	Chapter Generation: Use AI to identify and generate chapters within episodes.
	•	Timestamped Descriptions: Include timestamps in episode descriptions in the format (HH:MM:SS) Chapter Title.
	•	ID3 Tagging: Embed chapter information within the ID3v2 metadata container of audio files for compatibility with platforms like Apple Podcasts.

Technical Stack

Storage Solutions
	•	Audio Files: Stored in Cloudflare R2 for efficient delivery.
	•	Artwork, Transcripts, RSS XML: Stored in Amazon S3 to leverage its robust CDN capabilities, ensuring quick access and reliability.

Backend and Deployment
	•	Backend Services: Utilize Convex for database management and backend logic, providing a serverless and scalable solution.
	•	Deployment: Deploy the application using Vercel, offering seamless integration with frontend frameworks and efficient deployment workflows.

Type Safety
	•	TypeScript: Adopt TypeScript across the entire codebase to ensure consistent typing and minimize type-related errors.
	•	Libraries: Select libraries and frameworks that offer robust TypeScript support to maintain type safety throughout the development process.

API Design

Design internal API endpoints with a logical structure to facilitate potential future external API access. Ensure endpoints follow RESTful principles and maintain consistent data structures, allowing for easy expansion and integration.

Sample Unified RSS Feed

Below is a sample unified RSS feed structure that incorporates common XML namespace declarations, standard RSS channel metadata, iTunes-specific elements, image handling, and an example episode structure.
